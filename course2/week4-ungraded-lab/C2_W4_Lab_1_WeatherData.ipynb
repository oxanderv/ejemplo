        "# Ungraded Lab: Feature Engineering with Weather Data\n",
        "\n",
        "In this 1st exercise on feature engineering with time series data, you will practice data transformation with the [Weather Dataset](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/) recorded by the [Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/). You will be using [tf.Transform](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/transform/get_started) here instead of TFX because, as of this version (1.4), it is more straightforward to preserve the sequence of your records using this framework. If you remember, TFX by default always shuffles the data when ingesting through the `ExampleGen` component and that is not ideal when preparing data for forecasting applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "This dataset has 10-minute intervals of 14 different features such as air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity. For this lab, you will use only the data collected between 2009 and 2016. This section of the dataset was prepared by François Chollet for his book *Deep Learning with Python*.\n",

        "Now that you have the transformed dataset, you will need to map it to training and test datasets whch can be used for training a model using TensorFlow. Since this is time series data, it makes sense to group a fixed-length series of measurements and map that to the label found in a future time step. For example, 3 days of data can be used to predict the next day's humidity. You can use the [tf.data.Dataset.window()](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#window) method to implement these groupings.\n",

        "\n",
        "* You already know that data is taken every 10 minutes so there will be 720 data points for 5 days. \n",
        "* You will also assume that drastic change is not expected within an hour so you will downsample the 720 data points to 120 by just getting the data every hour. Thus, you will use a *stride* (or step size) of 6 when getting the data points. This makes the `HISTORY_SIZE` for the feature window equal to 120. \n",
        "* For this single step prediction model (forecasting), the label for a dataset window will be the temperature 12 hours into the future.\n",
        "* By default, the `window()` method moves `size` (i.e. window size) steps at a time. For example, if you have a dataset with elements `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and you have `size=2`, then your results will look like: `[1, 2], [3, 4]`. You can reconfigure this behavior and move at smaller or larger steps with the `shift` parameter. For the same sample dataset with window `size=2` but with `shift=1`, the results will look like `[1, 2], [2,3], [3,4]` because the window is moving `1` element at a time."
